EXPERIMENTAL

RUN AWAY

FLY, YOU FOOLS

HERE BE DRAGONS






Get my gist?


Licensed under PostgreSQL license (because I reuse some PG code directly), but not done properly in repository yet...


How to build? Like any extension! make
How to use it? `jit_provider='copyjit'` in your postgresql.conf (after make install, of course)

EXPERIMENTAL!

WILL KILL YOUR DATA, YOUR COMPUTER AND TURN YOUR CRYPTOTHINGS INTO USELESS STUFF (wait, isn't it already... anyway)
